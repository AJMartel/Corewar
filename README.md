**Core War was inspired by a malicious virus written in the 80’s.** To deal with the self-replicating virus, a white hat hacker invented Reaper. It was a virus designed to spread and eliminate the malware. They fought fire with fire.

This inspired A. K. Dewdney to coin the idea for Core War.

The idea was simple. Compete by designing viruses to overtake a computer. You win by protecting your own program, overwrite opponents program and find clever ways to spread your code. This is all happening on a virtual computer. Think, a mini computer within a computer. 

This is what is looks like in action.
