**Core War was inspired by a malicious software written in the 80â€™s.** A hacker wrote an assembly virus, Creeper. He then attacked a large corporation with his virus. To deal with it, a smart employee invented Reaper. It was a virus to spread and defeat the Creeper. They fought fire with fire. A clever move. 

This inspired A. K. Dewdney to coin the idea for Core War. The year was 1984. Yes, 1984. The year the dystopian prophecy of George Orwell kicked in. IBM was about to take over the world our last hope was Steve Jobs. 

The idea was simple, create viruses to overtake a computer. You win by protecting your own program, overwrite opponents program and find clever ways to spread your code. This is all happening on a virtual computer. Think, a mini computer within a computer.
